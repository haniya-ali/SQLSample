# SQL Sample: Film Database Insights
**Introduction**
This repository contains a working sample of SQL queries that were developed as part of an upper-division class project. The project focused on analyzing a film database to extract various insights about actors, popular movies, film ratings, and more. The queries provided in this repository demonstrate the use of SQL to retrieve meaningful information from the database.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is a mini IMDb film database, which includes information about actors, their roles, ratings, and film titles. The database schema is designed to capture the relationships between movies, actors, and other entities in the film industry.

**SQL Queries**
The SQL queries in this repository showcase different aspects of data analysis and exploration. Each query is carefully constructed to retrieve specific information from the film database. The queries cover a range of topics, including:

Actors: Retrieve details about actors, such as their names, birth years, and primary profession.

Ratings: Analyze film ratings to understand average ratings and the number of votes.

Role: Explore different categories and characters corresponding to an actor.

Title: Investigate relationships between films, genres, runtime, etc.

**Additional information**
The SQL commands were run in jupyter lab by establishing a SQLAlchemy connection and connecting the respective database.
